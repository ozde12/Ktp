You will be asked a series of yes/no questions about the animal's features. If you make a mistake, do not worry, you can restart the process at any time.\n",

Please keep in mind that the system may not always be accurate and cannot classify every possible animal. In some cases, the system may not be able to determine a specific class or subgroup, but it will still provide the best possible classification group.\n",
